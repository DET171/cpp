# Structs and Classes

Pain :)

### Structs


Pair but not a pair
```cpp
struct{
  int x,y;
  char c;
} name;
```
This initialises a struct called name. You can now input this struct
```cpp
std::cin>>name.x>>name.y>>name.c;
```
or
```cpp
scanf("%d%d%c",&name.x,&name.y,&name.c);
```
You can also initialise a structs as a data structure (what am i saying it is a data structure)
```cpp
int main()
{
  //single variable
  name name1={0,0,'c'};
  //array
  name s[n];
}
```

### Classes
idk bro go ask someone else
