## Introduction
`Informatics olympiads`, also known as `competitive programming`, is a form of programming where contestants are required to solve problems within a certain time limit. Their code will be checked against a set of inputs and outputs, which determine if the code is correct. This form of programming requires a vast amount of knowledge in common algorithms, math, as well as logical thinking.
