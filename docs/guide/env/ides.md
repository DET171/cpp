# Code Editors/IDEs
I mean, you can use a plain-text editor like Notepad, but for optimal development experience, you should use a code editor or IDE. A few of the most popular ones are listed below.

## Neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) is a fork of [Vim](https://www.vim.org). It is a terminal-based text editor, and written in C and Lua. You can use it together with [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), which is an IDE layer for Neovim.
