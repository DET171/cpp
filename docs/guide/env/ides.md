# Code Editors/IDEs
I mean, you can use a plain-text editor like Notepad, but for optimal development experience, you should use a code editor or IDE. A few of the most popular ones are listed below.

## Neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) is a fork of [Vim](https://www.vim.org). It is a terminal-based text editor, and written in C and Lua. You can use it together with [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), which is an IDE layer for Neovim.

## Visual Studio Code
My personal favourite, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, open-source (kinda) code editor/IDE developed by Microsoft. It is written in TypeScript and runs on Electron. It has a lot of extensions, and is very customizable. 

I like to use it with Github Copilot :D

## Sublime Text
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a lightweight code editor that's not free, but has a unlimited trial period (so I don't really see the difference).

## Good Ol' Vim
[Vim](https://www.vim.org) is a terminal-based text editor, and written in C. It is a very powerful editor, and you can use it together with [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugins.

## Atom
Deprecated. Still feel kinda sad about it.

## CLion
Is paid, uses more RAM than GTA V in a VM, would 100% not recommend.
