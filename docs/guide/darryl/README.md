# Darryl is not good at cpp but tries ig

So apparently we're supposed to write experience or something but I just learnt cpp a week ago so here is what I know.

## Data Types
1. Integers - 4 byte large variable to store numbers. (Example: 6 or 12442)
2. Float - 4 byte large variable to store decimal numbers up to 7 decimal digits. (Example: 5.63562 or 62.23462)
3. Double - 8 byte large variable to store decimal numbers up to 15 decimal digits. 
4. Boolean - 1 byte large variable to store True or False.
5. Char - 1 byte large variable to store a single character. (EXample: D or e)
6. String - For storing text.

## Basic Programs
### Hello World
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout<<"Hello World";
  return 0;
  }
 ```
 So basically, this program will return the text "Hello World". I'm going to go through how the code works.
 First off, #include will include certain files into a program. This will allow us to use whatever is in, in this case, iostream.
 "using namespace std" allows us to define what namespace we want to use. STD, in this case, stands for standard. Of course, you can forgo this and use std:: when you want to use it. However, it is better to define namespace .
 int main() {} Creates a function. The name of this function is main. The code is written in {}.
 cout basically prints, or writes, a certain text. 
 In C++, you must end all arguments with ;
