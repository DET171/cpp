# CPP Guide for Competitive Programming (HCI EC³)

This a guide made by a few EC³ dudes in Lower Secondary. Have fun reading and getting confused!

## Intro to CP

`Informatics olympiads`, also known as `competitive programming`, is a form of programming where contestants are required to solve problems within a certain time limit.
Their code will be checked against a set of inputs and outputs, which determine if the code is correct.
This form of programming requires a vast amount of knowledge in common algorithms, math, as well as logical thinking.

### Hello, World!

A very simple program allowing you to AC [this CP problem](https://codebreaker.xyz/problem/helloworld)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World";
  return 0;
}
```
